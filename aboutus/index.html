                        <p class="card-text">The symbol of SPIC MACAY is the "EYE" which represents Lord Shiva's third
                            eye. According to Hindu mythology Parvati the
                            consort of Lord Shiva playfully once blindfolded Him which clouded the world with profound
                            darkness of ignorance and
                            evil. The benevolent Lord then graced the world with bliss of knowledge and wisdom, opening
                            is third eye on his
                            forehead. This reveals one has to close his eyes to this materialistic and phony world in
                            order to awaken the spiritual
                            light from within.

                            The “big bang” of SPIC MACAY came in 1972 at a concert of Ustad Aminuddin Dagar and Ustad
                            Zia Fariduddin Dagar at the
                            Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York. The idea took a more defined direction in 1977 in
                            India. In early 1978, a concert
                            of the Dagar Bandhu, was held at IIT Delhi. In 1979, a two day programme again held at IIT
                            Delhi of Ustad Bismillah
                            Khan, Dagar Bandhu, Ustad Amjad Khan and Ustad Shahid Parvez. It was this in programme that
                            the name SPIC MACAY was
                            launched and the aim expressed was not to fight westernization but the process of
                            deculturisation.
